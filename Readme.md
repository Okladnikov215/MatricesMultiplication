# MatricesMultiplication

This is a project which implements matrices multiplication using "System.Threading.Tasks" library

It has overloaded *operator which does casual sequential multiplication and Matrix.ParallelMultiplyWithTask which utilizes Task class only.
Also there is Matrix.ParallelMultiplyWithFor that uses Parallel.For which is the easiest way to parallel matrices multiplication.
